**AI × Tech × Wellness** — Helping you manage life through learning about yourself.

---

### 🌱 About Us
We’re a team of University of Michigan students who joined the **Tech+ competition** on a whim and ended up building something much bigger — and more personal.  

What started as a productivity app idea has grown into a **registered company** focused on blending **therapy, design, and time management** to help people (especially ADHD minds) navigate life with more understanding and less judgment.  

Our mission:  
> **To create tools that don’t just help you plan your time — but help you understand yourself.**

### 💡 What We’re Building
Our flagship project is a **therapeutical time-management app** that combines cognitive science, mindfulness, and AI-assisted reflection.

**Key features include:**
- 🧘 **Non-judgmental scheduling:** If you miss something, just gently reschedule — no guilt.
- ⚖️ **Emotional load tracking:** AI helps you balance productivity and emotional energy.
- 📓 **Reflection journal:** Celebrate what you’ve done instead of punishing what you didn’t.
- 🎨 **Calming, cute UI:** Minimal, rounded, and relaxing — a space that feels kind.

### 💖 Our Philosophy
ADHD isn’t a flaw — it’s a different way of processing the world.  
We believe technology should meet people where they are, not where they “should” be.  

> “If you lose focus, don’t judge yourself — just gently bring your attention back.”  

That’s not just our UX rule. It’s our life rule.
