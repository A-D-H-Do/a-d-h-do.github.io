title: "Welcome! From Tech+ to a registered company"
---

We joined **Tech+** on a whim, formed a team, and I ended up PM’ing.  
As we built, the idea evolved from a productivity app into something **therapeutical**—a gentler way to plan, reflect, and keep going.

Big milestone: we **registered the company** 🎉  
This blog will share our progress, research notes, UI sketches, and calls for **beta testers**.

If you’re in EECS, follow along and try the app when we launch!
